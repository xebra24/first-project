So far, these are the implemented features:
 - Input and display how many pancakes each person ate
 - Display who ate the least and who ate the fewest
 - Allow user to edit how many pancakes a user ate (but not with the ease I would like)
Planned additions:
 - Input which user you would like to adjust
 - Average and median number of pancakes eaten
 - Ordered list of who has eaten the most
 - Allow user to input how many people there are
