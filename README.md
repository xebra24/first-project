# first-project
My first C++ and first GitHub project!
This project is adapted from the "Pancake glutton" project on this website: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/

My name is Alex, I'm a high schooler and I'm teaching myself how to code. At the moment, I'm focusing on C++, but hope to expand my vocabulary in the future.
