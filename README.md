# first-project
My first C++ and first GitHub project!
This project is adapted from the "Pancake glutton" project on this website: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/

My name is Alex, I'm a high schooler and I'm teaching myself how to code. At the moment, I'm focusing on C++, but hope to expand my
vocabulary of languages in the future.

As far as this project is concerned, it's pretty basic. You are asked how many pancakes each person ate. You can then review your 
entries and if it is incorrect, you can edit them.
